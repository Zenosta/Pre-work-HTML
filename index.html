        <article style="color:green">
            Starting out, this wasn't something easy for me to do. I personally don't spend a lot of time looking at myself, trying to decide what is the best
            things to say about me. I know we are just suppose to discribe what or who the type of person we are. But in a nut shell thats me, I don't 100%
            know me! With that being said, I'm a 37 year old male. I have a lovely wife and 7 amazing children, my childrens age range from 12 years old all the 
            way down to 6 months old I can personally say I have all the fun ages. I have lived in michigan my whole life, don't a lot of traveling in my younger
            days, so I have seen a lot of the united states! My personal favor state would have to be Colorado, ever since my first visit there driving into
            Colorado, Springs while a thunderstorm was rolling in, just seeing that it was amazing to look at high in the mountains looking over the city at about
            cloud level just simple stunning! I started to ramble a bit there, back to the task at hand.

            <h1 style="color:blue">Hobbies</h1>
            <br>
            With hobbies its kind of an funny thing to look into, because I really don't have many hobbies at this point other than playing videos games.
            I would say spending time with my children is a hobby but to me that seem like the right thing to add here! I will say I do have hobbies I do 
            with my children for instance my 8 year old is very big into arts and crafts! I personally have never been very good at that type of stuff 
            but because he has been very interested I have gone out of my way to learn how to make things that he wants to try and make so I can teach him how.
            A lot of my hobbies are all wrapped around my children and what they enjoy doing besides video games even tho my kids love video games as well, 
            I just simple can't play the games they do. With that being said when it is video game time/screen time we pretty much all do our own thing besides 
            my wife and I, we play the same games normally. I guess we can back date the hobbies, I use to play soccer all the time when I was younger
            I played on multiple travel teams, played Semi-pro for a few years! Even almost had the chance to go to the olympics until some stuff changed with
            the rules, and professional players could be used! I do dabble in soccer with my children, after they watch what dad can do with a soccer ball they 
            want to learn and try as well, but that brings me back to my children being the biggest part of my extra time! Oh one last thing, again I watch a lot
            of anime but most of the time has to be kid friendly because my 12 and 8 year old love the more child friendly stuff like <cite>My hero Acadamia</cite>.

            <h1 style="color:greenyellow">Why a Developer</h1>
            <br>
            Why oh why did I decide I want to be a developer, know there could be long hours, stressful deadlines, make or break work! Personally I have to say
            the big reason is, I love research and problem solving! Plus you know the money isn't that bad either after a while. Seriously tho all jokes aside, I 
            have been messing around with scripting/Macros a lot when I was younger I even dabbled in a little bit of hex editing for diablo 2. But when my kids
            start to come around I walked away from all that to just find work to pay the bills and get by. But personally I'm done with that I want to learn a 
            skill that I know I can learn and really make a career instead of living day by day! I want to show my children if you really want something and apply
            yourself you can go out and get it! Thats why I'm here I want the hands on training to learn break this stuff down and really learn it! I do have to say
            I have tried many different types of IT, it just didn't seem to fit me from cyber secruity, networking, A++ type stuff, I just feel that coding is for me!
            After experiencing all of that stuff I can say cyber secruity is the scariest, networking is your middle man, and A++ well thats boring and to simple. I 
            coding for me will be perfect, it will get me to research and really push me towards my strengths problem solving! Thats it for why I want to be a developer
            the reason why I'm here!

            I would like to take this time now to thank you for visiting my website, and finding out a little bit more about how I tick. I know this wasn't as detailed as
            could have been, I have skipped over a lot of details I could have added but if I would have not held myself back a little, this would be a 14 page website instead
            of a single page or we would have had to scroll forever! I tried to keep it as simple and straight to the point as I could with a few jokes in there! But please if
            have more questions don't hesitate to shot me an email, I will get back to you As soon as humanily possible! Thank you for your time!
